# Webflow Collection Utilities

Utility functions for extending the functionality of Webflow CMS collections on the front-end.

This package provides a set of helper functions that adds functionality to allow the user to dynamically sort, search and filter through a Webflow CMS collection.

It is developed with the intention to:

- Be fast and extremely lightweight,
- Be flexible enough to accomodate a wide range of use cases,
- Be brutally simple to use, even for non-programmers.
